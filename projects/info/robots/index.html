					ROBOTS!!!!!!!

			<p>
				Robots are a really cool new emerging technology!
			</p>
			<p>
				People are using robots more and more in places like assembly lines and car factories.

				Robots are much more efficient than people and are really cool!
			</p>
			<p>
				Some robots have even been adapted as toys like this little fella! He might be my favorite! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
