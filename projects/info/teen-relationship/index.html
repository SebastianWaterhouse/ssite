				While it is curable, some of the conditions that arise from hypertension can follow you around for life. For instance, you could suffer permanent ocular damage, kidney failure, or atherosclerosis (WebMD). Another danger with hypertension is that you can abate the symptoms, but leave an underlying cause untreated. It is especially important to start watching out for your health now as many dangerous behaviors such as alcohol abuse, elevated stress levels, sleep deprivation, and tobacco use are being introduced into your lives and can cause many disorders, hypertension not the least of them (Pescatello; Palagini; Kulkarni; Grollman; Virdis; Husain). Being a teenager is hard, and you don't need the extra stress of possibly permanent damage to your body because of your initial stress. As teenagers, we are susceptible to the allure of fast food or other culinary shortcuts. It is important that we watch what we eat however, and, even though it is sometimes unavoidable, to eat healthily. This is also important because high sodium intake, as is commonly associated with fast food, is one of the biggest contributors to hypertension. It's not all over, though. At this age, our meat sacks are malleable, which is both a curse and a boon. While you have to live with your mistakes, you can stop hypertension before it starts.
